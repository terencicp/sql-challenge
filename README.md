# SQL Challenge: E-commerce data analysis

The 11 .sql files contain the queries from a Kaggle notebook I wrote to showcase the capabilities of SQL for data analysis. To run these queries, download the SQLite database file from:

[E-commerce dataset by Olist (SQLite)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terencicp/e-commerce-dataset-by-olist-as-an-sqlite-database)

For more information have a look at the original notebook:
